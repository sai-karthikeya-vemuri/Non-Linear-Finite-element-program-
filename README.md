# Non-Linear-Finite-element-program-
A finite element code to solve the problem of creep of a thick-walled pipe under internal pressure with visco-elastic behaviour
### Problem Statement 
The problem of creep of a thick-walled pipe under internal pressure p is considered
as sketched . The pressure rises linearly up to its final value pmax and
is then hold until final time. Plain strain along z direction is 0 conditions are
assumed.
